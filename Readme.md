Project
=================
The aim is to develop AutoPricing code, compatible with the PricingPlatforms. This will help
having the results of PricingPlatforms uploaded automatically on Earnix. The code is bulit
based on the Autopricing Python tool developed by Haifang. However, changes made to make it 
in R.


Setting Up
=================
I have been trying to minimize the number of required libraries. However, for the first version it is 
early to discuss the dependencies.


Deploying

At the moment it is very fast at only requires R, to produce a set of JAVA commands.
